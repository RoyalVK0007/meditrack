## PAGE 4: ABSTRACT

**ABSTRACT**

The MediTrack Hospital Management System v1.0 Beta is a comprehensive, offline-first web-based application designed to streamline hospital operations and enhance healthcare service delivery. This project addresses the critical need for efficient patient management, medical record keeping, and administrative processes in healthcare facilities, particularly those with limited internet connectivity or strict data privacy requirements.

The system is built using modern web technologies including Node.js for server-side development, MySQL for robust data management, and responsive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for the user interface. The application features a role-based authentication system supporting four user types: administrators, doctors, nurses, and receptionists, each with specific access privileges and functionalities.

Key features implemented include comprehensive patient registration and management, real-time vitals tracking with interactive Chart.js visualizations, medication inventory management, automated billing system with PDF invoice generation, and detailed reporting capabilities. The system incorporates advanced security measures including HTTPS encryption, email-based OTP verification, audit logging, and input validation to ensure data integrity and user authentication.

The offline-first architecture ensures continuous operation even with intermittent internet connectivity, making it ideal for healthcare facilities in remote areas or those requiring strict data localization. The system supports complete patient lifecycle management from admission to discharge, with features for vitals monitoring, prescription management, and financial tracking.

Testing results demonstrate the system's reliability, security, and user-friendliness. The application successfully handles concurrent users, maintains data consistency, and provides responsive performance across different devices and browsers.

This project contributes to the digitization of healthcare services by providing an affordable, secure, and comprehensive hospital management solution that can be deployed locally without dependency on external cloud services.
